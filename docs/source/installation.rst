Building and Installing
=======================
Currently, flashlight must be built and installed from source.

Building/installing flashlight creates ``libflashlight``, which contains the entire flashlight library. Headers are contained in ``flashlight/``, which is placed in the specified ``include`` directory after install.

First, clone flashlight from `its repository on Github <https://github.com/facebookresearch/flashlight>`_:

::

   git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/flashlight.git


Build Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A C++ compiler with good C++11 support (e.g. g++ >= 5)
- `cmake <https://cmake.org/>`_ -- version 3.5.1 or later, and ``make``

Dependencies
------------

flashlight can be built with either a CUDA, CPU (in development), or OpenCL (coming soon) backend. Requirements vary depending on which backend is selected.

- For all backends, `ArrayFire <https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/wiki>`_ >= `3.7.1 <https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/releases/tag/v3.7.1>`_ is required. flashlight can also be built flashlight with `ArrayFire 3.6.2 <https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/releases/tag/v3.6.2>`_ - `3.6.4 <https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/releases/tag/v3.6.4>`_, but only using commits ``<= 5518d91b7f4fd5b400cbc802cfbecc0df57836bd``.

  - Using ArrayFire >= 3.7.1 enables features that significantly improve performance; using it is highly recommended.

- The following dependencies are `downloaded, built, and installed automatically` with flashlight:

  - `Cereal <https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal>`_ is required for serialization -- the `develop` branch must be used.

  - If building tests, `Google Test <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_ >= 1.10.0 is required.


Distributed Training Dependencies
---------------------------------
Building with distributed training is optional. See ``Build Options`` below.

- Regardless of backend, running with distributed training requires an MPI installation. `OpenMPI <https://www.open-mpi.org/>`_ is recommended if supported on your OS. On most Linux-based systems, ``sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev`` is sufficient.
- If building the CUDA backend, `NVIDIA's NCCL library <https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl>`_ is required. Flashlight has been tested with NCCL 2.2.13.
- If building with the CPU backend, `Facebook's Gloo library <https://github.com/facebookincubator/gloo>`_ is required, and must be built with MPI; after installing OpenMPI, pass the ``-DUSE_MPI=ON`` flag to ``cmake`` when building Gloo.

CUDA Backend Dependencies
-------------------------

- CUDA >= 9.2 is required. flashlight has been tested with `CUDA 9.2 <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-92-download-archive>`_ and less extensively with CUDA 10.0.
- CUDNN >= 7.1.2 is required. flashlight has been tested with `CUDNN 7.1.2 <https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive>`_.

CPU Backend Dependencies
------------------------

The CPU backend is currently under active development. Required dependencies include:

- Intel's `MKL-DNN <https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn/>`_ framework. While not required, using Intel's `Math Kernel Library <https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl>`_ >= 2017 `when building and installing MKL-DNN <https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn/#using-intel-mkl-optional>`_ is highly recommended for better performance. flashlight has been tested with MKL-DNN linked to MKL >= 2017.
  - We currently require mkldnn v0, due to breaking changes in v1. So make sure to use the `mnt-v0` branch: `git clone https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn.git -b mnt-v0`

If building MKL-DNN and flashlight with MKL, the flashlight build needs to be able to find it. The environment variable ``MKLROOT`` must be set to a directory where the MKL installation is located. This should be done in the same shell session where ``cmake`` is to be run when building flashlight. On most Linux-based systems, the correct command will be:

.. code-block:: shell

   export MKLROOT=/opt/intel/mkl

OpenCL Backend Dependencies
---------------------------

The OpenCL backend is not currently supported.

Building on Linux or MacOS
--------------------------
flashlight has been thoroughly tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and above, CentOS 7.5, and macOS 10.14, but has good compatability with older operating systems.

Building from source on Linux and MacOS is simple:

.. code-block:: shell

  # in the flashlight project directory:
  mkdir -p build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFLASHLIGHT_BACKEND=[backend] # valid backend
  make -j4  # (or any number of threads)
  make test

To change the location of the install, simply `set CMake's <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html>`_ ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` before running ``cmake``, then:

.. code-block:: shell

 make install

To build a shared object, simply `set CMake's <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html>`_ ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` when running ``cmake``.

Building with Conan on Linux
----------------------------
flashlight's CUDA backend is available on Linux with `Conan <https://conan.io/>`_. Adding it to your project is easy: simply add ``('flashlight/0.1@conan/stable')`` to your ``conanfile``'s requirements.

The Conan package for flashlight `can be found here <https://bintray.com/flashlight/flashlight>`_.

Building on Windows
-------------------
Building flashlight on Windows is not supported at this time (coming soon).

Building/Running flashlight with Docker
---------------------------------------
flashlight and its dependencies can also be built with the provided Dockerfile.

To build flashlight with Docker:

- Install `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_
- For CUDA backend install `nvidia-docker <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/>`_
- Run the given Dockerfile in a new container:

.. code-block:: shell

 # for CUDA backend
 sudo docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm -itd --ipc=host --name flashlight flml/flashlight:cuda-latest
 # for CPU backend
 sudo docker run --rm -itd --name flashlight flml/flashlight:cpu-latest
 # go to terminal in the container
 sudo docker exec -it flashlight bash

- to run tests inside a container

.. code-block:: shell

 cd /root/flashlight/build && make test

- Build Docker image from source:

.. code-block:: shell

 git clone --recursive https://github.com/facebookresearch/flashlight.git
 cd flashlight
 # for CUDA backend
 sudo docker build -f ./Dockerfile-CUDA -t flashlight .
 # for CPU backend
 sudo docker build -f ./Dockerfile-CPU -t flashlight .

Building Your Project with flashlight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once flashlight is built and installed, including it in another project is simple, using CMake `or with Conan <https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_. Suppose we have a project in ``project.cpp`` that uses flashlight:

::

   #include <iostream>

   #include <arrayfire.h>
   #include "flashlight/flashlight.h"

   /**
    * ###### #         ##    ####  #    # #      #  ####  #    # #####
    * #      #        #  #  #      #    # #      # #    # #    #   #
    * #####  #       #    #  ####  ###### #      # #      ######   #
    * #      #       ######      # #    # #      # #  ### #    #   #
    * #      #       #    # #    # #    # #      # #    # #    #   #
    * #      ####### #    #  ####  #    # ###### #  ####  #    #   #
    */
   int main() {
     fl::Variable v(af::constant(1, 1), true);
     auto result = v + 10;
     std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
     af::print("Array value is ", result.array()); // 11.000
     return 0;
   }

We can link flashlight with the following CMake configuration. If using Conan, you'll need the extra CMake components as they're given:

.. code-block:: shell

  # CMake 3.5.1+ is required
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5.1)
  # C++ 11 is required
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

  # If using Conan, run setup
  include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/conanbuildinfo.cmake)
  conan_basic_setup(TARGETS)

  # If you're not using Conan, find needed packages directly:
  find_package(flashlight REQUIRED)
  find_package(ArrayFire REQUIRED)
  # ...

  # If using Conan, you'll also need to link system libraries.
  # For example, if using the CUDA backend:
  find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

  add_executable(myProject project.cpp)

  # the correct ArrayFire backend is transitively included by flashlight
  target_link_libraries(
    myProject
    PRIVATE
    # If building the package directly:
    flashlight::flashlight
    # If using Conan:
    CONAN_PKG::flashlight
    ${CUDA_LIBRARIES} # system libs needed if using Conan
  )

The above will automatically link all flashlight backend-specific dependencies and will add the correct directories to the target's (``myProject``'s) include directories.
