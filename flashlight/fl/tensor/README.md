# The `fl::Tensor` Framework

**Note: `fl::Tensor` is a work in progress.** Potential API breakage is possible as development continues. We'll do our best to adapt existing code as the API evolves.

`fl::Tensor` is an effort to create a portable tensor frontend that facilitates integrating custom tensor computation stacks for research at the *library, compiler, and hardware level*. It provides:
- An unopinionated API with which tensor libraries can be implemented or wrapped
- Compute-level functions that help define implementation requirements
- Tests to ensure equivalent expected behavior
- Benchmarks in accordance with Flashlight to test end-to-end performance with a variety of state-of-the-art neural networks

In general, the framework *eschews opinionation* and provides the minimum viable surface on top of which to integrate a new tensor backend with *minimal footprint*. **`fl::Tensor` is not an IR**: the user is to define everything under the base interface.

### A Small, Unopinionated API Surface

Tensor stack research can be challenging in that large-scale research frameworks can be opinionated, providing rigid APIs or IRs on top of which to develop compilers and require significant changes to modify internals. `fl::Tensor` prioritizes the following to facilitate development:
1. **Small API footprint**: a small, simple interface to add tensor ops.
2. **User-defined internals**: implement thingsÂ under a standard, high-level API; no pre-specified IRs.
3. **Compute-model flexibility**: users can integrate JITs, eager-evaluation libraries, and others, with few requirements.

## Implementing or Adding a Tensor Backend
At a high level, implementing an `fl::Tensor` backend is simple and requires subclassing two interfaces:
1. [`TensorAdapterBase`](https://github.com/flashlight/flashlight/blob/master/flashlight/fl/tensor/TensorAdapter.h), which defines operations for member functions on an `fl::Tensor`.
2. [`TensorBackend`](https://github.com/flashlight/flashlight/blob/master/flashlight/fl/tensor/TensorBackend.h) which defines global tensor operations.

Tensor backend implementations should be placed in `tensor/backend/[backend name]`; for example, the ArrayFire backend implementation resides in `tensor/backend/af`.

### Example with an Implementation Stub
In this example, we'll integrate a new `FooBaz` backend.

First, we'll add derived implementations of the `TensorAdapterBase` and `TensorBackend` interfaces. We've created a new directory: `flashlight/fl/tensor/backend/foobaz` and added a `CMakeLists.txt` that links dependency and compiles files with our implementations:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

find_package(FooBazBackendDep REQUIRED) # if our backend depends on something external
target_link_libraries(flashlight PUBLIC FooBazBackendDep::FooBazBackendDep)

target_sources(
    flashlight
    PRIVATE
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/FooBazTensor.cpp
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/FooBazBackend.cpp
)
```
and we'll gate building our backend in `flashlight/fl/tensor/CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
# ...
# adding a CMake option to build the backend. Passing -DFL_USE_FOOBAZ=ON when
# running cmake will build the backend.
option(FL_USE_FOOBAZ "Build FooBaz tensor backend" OFF)

if (FL_USE_FOOBAZ)
  include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/backend/foobaz/CMakeLists.txt)
endif()

# ...

# Add a compile definition for compile-time use
target_compile_definitions(
  flashlight
  PUBLIC
  FL_USE_ARRAYFIRE=$<BOOL:${FL_USE_ARRAYFIRE}>
  FL_USE_FOOBAZ=$<BOOL:${FL_USE_FOOBAZ}> # added
)
# ...
```

Now, we'll add `FooBazTensor.h`, also in `flashlight/fl/tensor/backend/foobaz` which defines the class `FooBazTensor`, derived from [`TensorAdapterBase`](./TensorAdapterBase.h), as follows:
```cpp
#include "flashlight/fl/tensor/TensorAdapter.h"
#include "flashlight/fl/tensor/Shape.h"
#include "flashlight/fl/tensor/Index.h"

class FooBazTensor : public fl::TensorAdapterBase {
  // We can store state and metadata associated with our tensor here.
 public:
  // Provide a constructor to create a FooBazTensor using some existing data/a buffer:
  FooBazTensor(
    const Shape& shape,
    fl::dtype type,
    void* ptr,
    Location memoryLocation);
  // ...

  // Add the backend type to the TensorBackendType enum in TensorBase.h, then implement:
  TensorBackendType backendType() const override;

  // Override other interface functions. For example:
  const Shape& shape() override; // returns a Flashlight shape
  void device(void** out) override; // returns a pointer to device memory, if applicable.
  Tensor index(const std::vector<Index>& indices) override; // indexing operator
  // ...
};
```
We write our implementations in `FooBazTensor.cpp` accordingly and are omitted here. If our `FooBazTensor` doesn't support some operations, we can have them throw exceptions, or alternatively include, depend on, and delegate to implementations in another existing `fl::Tensor` backend. See the [tensor adapter interface documentation](./TensorAdapter.h) for function-level expected behavior.

Now, we'll create our backend implementation, `FooBazBackend.h`, also in `flashlight/fl/tensor/backend/foobaz`, where we'll define most tensor operations and can store global state related to our backend:
```cpp
#include "flashlight/fl/tensor/TensorBackend.h"

class FooBazBackend : public fl::TensorBackend {
  // We can store global state for our backend (dataflow graphs,
  // memory management, compute streams, op status, etc) here.
 public:
  // Performs pre-flight tasks when initializing the backend
  FooBazBackend();
  // ...

  // Ops on tensors. For example:
  Tensor transpose(const Tensor& tensor, const Shape& dims /* = {} */) override;
  Tensor exp(const Tensor& tensor) override;
  Tensor matmul(const Tensor& lhs, const Tensor& rhs) override;
  // ...
};
```
Implementations are in `FooBazBackend.cpp` (or distributed across other compilation units), and are ommitted here. As with `FooBazTensor`, if our backend doesn't support some operations, we can have those operations throw exceptions, or alternatively delegate to another existing backend. See the [backend interface documentation](./TensorBackend.h) for function-level expected behavior.


## Implementation Requirements
Below is a more formal definition of the implementation requirements for a tensor backend.

In addition to deriving from the `TensorAdapterBase` and `TensorBackend` interfaces, implementers are required to:
- **Provide memory interoperability** as defined in interfaces. This includes constructors to create tensors from arbitrary buffers either on the host or accelerator devices. These include:
  - `void fl::TensorAdapter::host(void** out)`, which provides a host-side host for an underlying tensor.
  - `void fl::TensorAdapter::device(void** out)`, which provides a device-side buffer pointing to an underlying tensor.
    - To avoid needing to copy device-side buffers, the API also provides `void unlock()`, which signals that a pointer to device memory can be freed if its corresponding tensor(s) are destroyed.
- **Implement compute synchronization primitives** as defined by interfaces. These include:
  - `void fl::TensorBackend::sync()()`: blocks the calling thread until all tensor computation for that backend is complete.
  - `void fl::TensorBackend::eval(Tensor&)`: launches any kernels that need to be executed to make the tensor's updated value available.
- **Pass all tests** as provided in `flashlight/fl/test/tensor` for implemented operators.

### Computation Model

Backends implemented with `fl::Tensor` can have both lazy and eager evaluation semantics. The `sync` and `eval` requirements above imply support for lazy evaluation, but one or both can be noops as long as implementation requirements are met.

There are no additional implementation requirements around memory usage besides the constructor, `host` and `device` functions above. Only tensors on which these memory-access functions are called need to have explicit buffers.

### Changing Default Behavior
To adjust the default backend with which Flashlight tensors are created, change the types and preprocessor calues in [`TensorAdapter.cpp`](https://github.com/flashlight/flashlight/blob/master/flashlight/fl/tensor/TensorAdapter.cpp) accordingly.
- **Note:** Flashlight's default tensor backend continues to be [ArrayFire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire), and newly-created tensors will be `fl::Tensor` will call into ArrayFire by default.
