 * Levearge OneDNN's post-ops to fuse operations.
 *
 * NOTE
 * 1. due to OneDNN limitation, binary post-op only supports rhs argument.
 * 2. currently we avoid recomputation -- fuse iff intermediate nodes are _only_
 *    used as input nodes in the chain. There might be places where benefit of
 *    aggressive fusion outweighs cost of recomputation, need to investigate
 *    more (think Halide).
