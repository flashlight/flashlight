/**
 * An object describing the dimensions of a tensor.
 *
 * The dimensions and sizes of a shape are explicit; where some tensor libraries
 * implement implicit dimensions (i.e. those that are 1 are ignored), Flashlight
 * Shapes can be of arbitrary size and 1-dimensions distinguish them.
 * Concretely, (3, 1) and (3) are distinct shapes. See ShapeTest for further
 * examples.
 *
 * Shapes dimensions should be >= 1 in size. Shapes with a zero dimension have
 * zero elements, even if other dimensions are of nonzero size. For example: a
 * Shape of (0) has zero elements, as does a Shape with dimensions (1, 2, 3, 0).
 *
 * Different tensor backends implement different shape and dimension semantics.
 * As such, these need to be converted back and forth to and from Flashlight
 * Shapes. Having a common set of behaviors in this API ensures that tensors and
 * their shapes can be freely-manipulated across tensor backends.
 *
 * Shape is an interface and can be derived from or implemented given specific
 * backing storage or handles.
