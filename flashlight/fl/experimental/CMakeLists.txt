project(flashlight-experimental)

# Experimental projects to build.
# To add your experimental project:
# - Add a subdirectory in `src/experimental`
# - Add a CMakeLists.txt file in that directory which builds your targets
#   (this will be automatically linked to the rest of flashlight, but can
#    also be linked to other dependencies)
# - Add a call to `include` below for your experimental
#   projects directory - for example:
#
#   include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/[some_project_dir]/CMakeLists.txt)
#
# Add includes here:


# Memory
include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/memory/CMakeLists.txt)

# Tests
include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/tests/CMakeLists.txt)

# - Also add your project's target name `FLASHLIGHT_EXPERIMENTAL_LIBS`
#   call below if you want your code to be installed with flashlight.
# - Note that experimental targets MUST be `INTERFACE` targets for
#   them to be installable with flashlight.
