# Python Bindings

Python binding components for Flashlight have been *moved out of this repository* and into **two external libraries:**
- [**Flashlight Text**](https://github.com/flashlight/text), which contains tools for text processing including a beam search decoder, dictionary abstraction, and tokenizer/
- [**Flashlight Sequence**](https://github.com/flashlight/sequence), which contains CPU and GPU-compatible implementations of sequence loss functions including Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and Auto Segmentation (ASG).

No other components of Python bindings remain in this repository. For questions or contributions regarding the above packages, please open issues or PRs in the respective repository.
