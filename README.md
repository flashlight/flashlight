# flashlight

flashlight is a fast, flexible machine learning library written entirely in C++
from the Facebook AI Research Speech team and the creators of Torch and
Deep Speech. It uses the [ArrayFire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire)
tensor library and features just-in-time compilation with modern C++.
flashlight supports both CPU (still in active development) and GPU backends for
maximum portability, and has an emphasis on efficiency and scale.

All documentation (including build/install instructions) can be found
